Here there can be found the classes responsible of the evolution of the netwroks.
This is a key part of the library, in charge of initializing and evolving the 
desired networks, using other class to achieve it. Is also important because is 
the one that the user will make use of.

:class:`~Evolving` class is the main class and the one in charge of evolving model descriptors.
Those descriptors and the atributes specified in the initialization will generate
network to evolve; so the stepts to follow are:
        
    1. Initialize this class with all the desired qualities.
    2. Call :func:`evolve` function.
    
:class:`~DescriptorContainer` is just an auxiliar class to help Evolving. It is 
used with the DEAP library and it represent the individul to be evolved.

    This is the main class and contains all the needed functions and atributes
    in order to realize the evolution. As is can be seen this class has many 
    atributes to initialice, this is due to its high cutomization. Many of 
    the parameters (like evol_kwargs or sel_kwargs) are not neccesary unless 
    custom evoluationary or selection functions are used. 
    
    In order to facilitate the use of this class, here is a table with the atributes
    used in the initialization of it. Is divided in three columns:
        
    * Required atributes: atributes that always have to be declared, because
      otherwise the initialization will be inclompleted and it will give an error.
    * Predefined atributes: atributes that are necesary and have to be declared but
      they already predefined with a value and there is no need to define them 
      (it will run, but with the predefined values), but they can be defined by the 
      user and custom the execution. 
      For example, evol_alg is intialize with 'mu_plus_lambda' algorithm and if Evolving 
      class is created without asigning a value to 'evol_alg it will run with it; but it
      can be declared and defined with 'mu_comm_lambda' or 'simple' algorithms.
    * Optional atributes: atributes that are not needed, it can be initialiced without
      defining these atributes. Even so, they can be defined and the initialization will
      be more custom and with more options.
